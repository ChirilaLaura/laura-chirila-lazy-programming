The UNIX operating system is designed around simplicity and the use of a small set of primitives that can be combined to perform complex tasks.

Core Architecture

* Three Layers: The system consists of the Kernel (controls hardware), the Shell (interprets user commands), and Useful Programs (editors, compilers, etc.).
* Modular Building Blocks: Programs are designed as individual units that can be “glued together” in diverse ways to solve problems.

The Pipeline and Modularity

* The Pipeline: Considered the system’s fundamental contribution, it allows multiple programs to be linked end-to-end so data flows automatically from one to the next.
* Efficiency: Complex applications, such as a spelling checker, can be built by piping existing tools (like `sort` and `unique`) together rather than writing new code from scratch.

The File System and I/O

* Byte Streams: A UNIX file is a simple sequence of bytes with no complex attributes required.
* Hierarchical Structure: Files are organized into a recursive hierarchy of directories, allowing users to group information naturally.
* Device Independence: Peripheral devices (printers, tape drives, etc.) are treated as files.
* Redirection: The Shell can redirect any program’s input or output to files or devices, a feature that applies universally because it is handled by the Shell rather than individual programs.

Programming and Portability

* Environment Tailoring: Users can save sequences of commands into files to automate repetitive tasks and customize their workspace.
* The C Language: Created specifically for UNIX, C is a high-level language that allows for machine-level access when necessary, making the operating system highly portable across different types of hardware.
