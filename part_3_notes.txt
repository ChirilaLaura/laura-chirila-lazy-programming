Paul Graham’s “Hackers and Painters” says programmers are makers, more like painters or writers than scientists, because great hacking is really about design and taste and building something people want. He argues that schools and big companies often judge the wrong things and push hackers into writing papers or implementing someone else’s plan instead of shaping the product through building it. He also points out that programming is usually a sketching process where you write something rough, test it, debug it, and keep refining, so good tools should make change easy and you should avoid locking in a perfect spec too early. He ends with a simple message about what makes great software: care about craft even in the parts users never see, and have empathy for users and for the future you who will have to read the code.
